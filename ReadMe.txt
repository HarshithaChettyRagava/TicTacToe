My First Page consists of total of 3 pages.
The first one is index.html which gives my information about 
past, present and future endeavours.

The second one is newpage.html which covers the tic tac toe game.
In this, i have added the code to display if you win the game or 
to display whether u lost or draw in the game.
Also, a reset button to play the game again.

The third one is contact.html which asks us to fill the contact form.
In addition to this, I have newly added the conditions as below:
     * If any field is empty, it wont allow you to submit the form.
     * There are few Mandatory fields in which you must enter the 
       required field, Otherwise it will give a prompt message to fill it.
     * I have added pattern condition, so that user will not allowed to
       enter bad data. For example, if you give email address which doesn't
       have proper format. It will prompt you to enter correct email id.
     * Upon clicking the submit button, the data will be received and 
       alert with message 'Thank You, We have received your information'.  
Also, it has links of my Github,Bitbucket and linkedIn profile.
